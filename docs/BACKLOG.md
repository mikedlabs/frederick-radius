# Backlog

Tracked, not urgent. Reviewed during the structure pass (June 2026).

## /radius — audited, mostly complete ✅
`/radius` already follows the structure-pass playbook: leads with the `WithinReach`
"best moves" strip, events are capped at top-5 with an "All N →" see-all, and the
full place list sits behind a "See everything" toggle (the count is demoted to a
secondary line, not the headline). **Do not rebuild it.** Small follow-ups only:

- [ ] Add **Transit** (nearest bus / MARC stop, with minutes) to the `WithinReach`
      reachable strip — currently missing because transit stops aren't in the
      `AmenityKind` set; needs transit-stop data plumbed into the inside-radius
      reach calc. Feature add, not a reorg.
- [ ] Optional later: small header/copy polish on the "Within reach" strip
      ("What you can reach from here") if it tests better. Cosmetic only.
